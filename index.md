## DESCRIPTION

The main focus of the course will be on smooth optimization techniques, with applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The course will introduce the basics of algorithms on continuous optimization, starting from the classical gradient descent algorithm in convex optimization, towards more sophisticated approaches in non-convex scenarios. The course will explore the fundamental theory, algorithms, complexity and approximations in nonlinear optimization. 

### PREREQUISITES

The prerequisites are linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability and statistics. AI/Machine learning courses are not necessary but highly recommended.

### COURSE OUTCOMES

After successful attendance, students are expected to:
+ have a good understanding of theory involved in optimization, via machine learning/AI applications
+ understand the differences of and the reasoning/logic behind optimization algorithms, such as SGD, adaptive methods (Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, etc), and second order methods.
+ have a good understanding of standard convex optimization techniques, both in theory and practice.
+ have a good understanding of the differences / difficulties of convex and non-convex optimization.
+ have a good comprehension how optimization plays a key role in different areas of ML/AI/SP.
+ be able to read and review advanced papers on similar subjects.

### COURSE POLICIES

- During Class
The electronic recording of notes will be important for class and so computers will be allowed in
class. Please refrain from using computers for anything but activities related to the class. 
Drinking (coffee, tea, water) is allowed in class. Try not to eat your lunch in class as the 
classes are typically active.

- Policies on Late Assignments
Assignments (scribing, reviews, project) should be turned on time. You receive a 10% penalty for 
each day of delay, up to 2 days. No submissions after the 2 day grace period. Exceptions will be 
given to very extreme circumstances, with proper documentations.

- Academic Integrity and Honesty
Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the 
Honor System Handbook ([*http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/*](http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/).

- Accommodations for Disabilities
If you have a documented disability that may affect academic performance, you should: 1) make sure
this documentation is on file with Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / 
[*adarice@rice.edu*](adarice@rice.edu) / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) meet with me to discuss 
your accommodation needs.
