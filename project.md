The course project can be catergorized as a literature review, as original research, or as a literature review that ends up as original research (there is flexibility to that).

- **Literature review.** This includes depth review and analysis of a paper (to be selected from a list of papers, provided by the instructor or by you, after instroctor's approval). The review should provide an in-depth summary, exposition and discussion of the paper (which will often include reading other related papers on that subject).

- **Original research.** You are strongly encouranged to combine your current research with the course project. Otherwise, the instructor will provide some ideas to follow. It can be either theoretical or experimental. 

### Milestones

- Pick a project the **sooner possible**.

- Submit a one-page description of the project, what is it about, your opinion, what needs to be done (related papers to read) and whether you have any ideas to improve the ideas involved. Describe why they are important or interesting, and provide some appropriate references. If it is original research, provide a plan on what are the next steps and what needs to be done till the end of the semester to finish the project. **Deadline: October 4th.**

- We will probably have in-class presentations towards the end of the semester. These will be spotlight talks (5mins). Prepare an oral presentation with slides. Focus on high-level ideas, and leave most technical details to your report.

- A written report. A LaTeX template will be provided (most probably in ICML format). The length of the report should be at least 6 pages (excluding references). **Deadline: End of the semester.** Note that the project can continue beyond the end of the semester, if it deserves publication.
